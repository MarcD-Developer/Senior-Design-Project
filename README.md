# Senior-Design-Project

Interactive Web Tools for Visualization.  

The aim of this project is to create a web based graph drawing tool which would allow a user to create or open their graphs on web-based application rather than downloading a program.


##Resources

This project uses the Javascript libraries, [Sigma.js] (https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/#sigmajs---v110) and [Linkurious.js] (https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js) for the functionality of the website. 

##Navigating through the code

There's several files in this project.  However, the main source file for the website is [here] (https://github.com/SmokedEel/Senior-Design-Project/blob/master/src/Project/index.html).  That file is where most of the project has been created, sent to one webpage for one to navigate through.
