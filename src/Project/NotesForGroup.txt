Thoughts so far:

Looked into bootstrap.  Seems to be a nice idea on how to build a website.  Interestingly enough, two pre built websites caught my eye.  Dashboard, and the Navbar templates.  

Mostly towards using the dashboard template as a basis for our graphing website.  However, we can use the navbar example for the dropdown menus that are on its page.  

In order to use these sources however, you would need to download bootstrap.  From there, it looks like there are several items it's pulling data from.  

So far so good.  Nothing wrong so far

Within bootstrap, the examples are found under.  .../docs/examples/ within the bootstrap folder

[HTML]
Meta - A tag that describes data. Won't appear but is machine parsable.  
DIV - Container




[JQuery]
pageX - The mouse position relative to the left edge of the document.
pageY - The mouse position relative to the top edge of the document.
